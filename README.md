# EducationalManagmentSystem
My first lovely spaghetti java project
I Did it before i learn git so EducationalManagment 2 is the complete project.

Although this project code is so unclean because it was my first project to practice oop principles, I had learnt alot from this project.

It increased my oop skills, Engineering skills and extremely raised my troubleshooting and debugging skills.

Having this project done pushed me towards learning more
