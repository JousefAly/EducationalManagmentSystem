# EducationalManagmentSystem
My first  java project
I did it before i learn git so EducationalManagment 2 is the complete project.

Although this project code is so unclean because it was my first project to practice oop principles, I had learnt alot from this project.

It increased my oop skills, Engineering skills and extremely raised my troubleshooting and debugging skills.

This System was all done In  memory without any storage system like files or database.

Having this project done pushed me towards learning more
